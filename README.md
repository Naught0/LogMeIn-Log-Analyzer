# LogMeIn-Log-Analyzer
A slipshod and attempt at a useful tool to parse and understand LogMeIn log files (with more formats supported later perhaps maybe)

## A few notes
* I'm learning C# as I go here
* The code is probably horribly unoptimized
* I don't know anything about OOP and I'm sure that translates into the code
* I've never designed a UI before
* This project gives a whole new meaning to "work in progress"
* The line count is broken and I would like to personally blame Microsoft and carriage returns

### And here's how it looks
