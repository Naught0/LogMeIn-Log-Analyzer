# LogMeIn-Log-Analyzer
A useful tool to parse and understand LogMeIn log files (with more formats supported later maybe)

## A few notes
* I'm learning C# as I go here
* The code is probably horribly unoptimized
* I've never designed a UI before

### And here's how it looks

### ToDo
* Add support for user-defined filters
* Add some regex support for pattern matching for filters
* Add custom theme support
* Add Windows update parser
* Clean up Sys info window 
* Add sys info export functionality 
* Add "find problems" dialog
* Add show-context dialog to right-click
